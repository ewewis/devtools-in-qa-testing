# DevTools in QA Testing

This repository contains a presentation created as part of my QA portfolio.

## 📊 About the presentation
The presentation shows how a **Junior QA / Manual Tester** can use browser DevTools to:
- identify UI and layout issues
- detect JavaScript errors
- analyze API requests and responses
- verify data stored in the browser
- test application behavior on slow or unstable networks

The focus is on **practical testing scenarios**, not on development or coding.
